# About project

## What is ‘*keki*’?

![logo](app/assets/images/Keki.png)

Keki is an online platform where merchants can showcase their cake artistry, promote their baking skills, connect with potential buyers for their cakes, and improve their reputation. Customers can easily find, buy a cake from a seller easily using keki.

## The problem

There are many whom have baking talent and creativity. They enjoy learning new recipes and baking challenges. They want to promote their next best selling confections.

Throughout the year, there are a number of unique days worth celebrating, whether it be a public holiday or a special occasion. These provide opportunities for society to celebrate together, often with food and drinks. However, party planners tend to struggle to find cakes satisfying the below conditions:

- unique and creative design
- customised design
- special requests/dietary restrictions
- the harmony of health and design 
- delivery/pickup options
- active interaction with sellers

## The solution 

Merchants are able to manage their sales through the app. The analytical data provided will help them satisfy the fluctuating demands and trends of customers.

The product can be customisable. They can add/remove ingredients and design as per customer’s preference. With their address information, customers can see the list of cakes made by merchants living close to their location for pickup. Utilising a message system enables customers to chat with a seller to discuss delivery/pickup and the additional price of special request. On top of that, they can leave reviews of a seller. Emails can be frequently sent to members regarding any update of new cakes and best selling cakes.
